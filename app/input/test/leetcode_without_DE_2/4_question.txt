CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    manager_id INT NULL,
    salary INT
)


Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
