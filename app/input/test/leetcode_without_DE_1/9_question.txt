CREATE TABLE UserActivity (
    username VARCHAR(30),
    activity VARCHAR(30),
    startDate DATE,
    endDate DATE
)


Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. 

A user can't perform more than one activity at the same time. Return the result table in any order.
