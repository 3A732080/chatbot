CREATE TABLE Queue (
    person_id INT,
    person_name VARCHAR(30),
    weight INT,
    turn INT
)


There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Use a subquery with the SUM function and the WINDOW function to calculate the total weight of each person after getting on the bus. Then select the last person who weighs no more than 1000 kilograms from this subquery, and finally use TOP 1 to select the first qualified person, and sort them in descending order of the running total to ensure that the last qualified person is selected.",
  "sql": "SELECT TOP 1 person_name FROM (SELECT person_id, person_name, weight, turn, SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total FROM Queue) AS tbl WHERE running_total <= 1000 ORDER BY running_total DESC;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
