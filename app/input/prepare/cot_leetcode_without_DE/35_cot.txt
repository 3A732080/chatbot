Example of question thirty-five

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT,
    new_price INT,
    change_date DATE
)


Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Find prices for all products on 2019-08-16. Assume that all products have a price of 10 before any price changes. Identify the last price change for each product before 2019-08-16. For products that have a recorded price change after this date, treat their price as 10. Use UNION ALL to combine the results of two scenarios: one to find products with the last price change, and one with no price change records or all price changes recorded after this date.",
  "sql": "SELECT p.product_id, p.new_price AS price FROM Products p WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) AS last_change FROM Products WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16' GROUP BY product_id HAVING product_id = p.product_id AND MAX(change_date) = p.change_date ) UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT(p.product_id), 10 AS price FROM Products p WHERE product_id IN ( SELECT product_id FROM Products GROUP BY product_id HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16' );"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
