output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "To count the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher, use COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) to count the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher and select teacher_id and COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) as the result and name it cnt. Next, use the GROUP BY clause to group the Teacher table by teacher_id.",
  "sql": "SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) as cnt FROM Teacher GROUP BY teacher_id;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
