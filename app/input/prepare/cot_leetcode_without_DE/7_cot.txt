CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(40)
)


Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Converts all characters in the name to lowercase, then converts the first character to uppercase. To achieve this goal, use SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1) to get the first character of the name, and then use UPPER() to convert the first character to uppercase. Then use SUBSTRING(name, 2, LEN(name)-1) to obtain all characters except the first character in the name, and then use LOWER() to convert all characters except the first character to lowercase. Finally, the CONCAT() function is used to combine the two parts to form the revised name, and by selecting user_id and the revised name in the SELECT clause, the ORDER BY clause is used to sort by user_id.",
  "sql": "Select user_id, concat(upper(substring(name,1,1)),lower(substring(name,2,len(name)-1))) as name from users Order by user_id;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
