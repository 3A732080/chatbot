CREATE TABLE Triangle (
    x INT,
    y INT,
    z INT
)


Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

output

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Use the CASE WHEN conditional expression to determine whether each set of three line segments can form a triangle. That is, when x+y>z, x+z>y and y+z>x are satisfied at the same time, it means that a triangle can be formed. In this case, 'Yes' is returned; otherwise, 'No' is returned. Finally, select all the fields and the triangle you just calculated to form the result, and name it triangle.",
  "sql": "select * , (case when x+y>z and x+z>y and y+z>x then 'Yes' else 'No' end) as triangle from triangle;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
