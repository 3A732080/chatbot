CREATE TABLE Patients (
    patient_id INT,
    patient_name VARCHAR(30),
    conditions VARCHAR(100)
)


Write a solution to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.

Return the result table in any order.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Finds all patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes whose condition is prefixed with "DIAB1". Use the LIKE operator and the wildcard character ('%') to filter out records whose conditions field value contains a condition that begins with "DIAB1". To ensure that "DIAB1" is the beginning of the condition code, you can add a space before conditions to ensure that the LIKE pattern matches a complete condition code.",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM Patients WHERE CONCAT(' ',conditions) LIKE '% DIAB1%';"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
