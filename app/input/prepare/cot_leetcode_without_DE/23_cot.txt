Example of question twenty-three
---

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    sale_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    year INT,
    quantity INT,
    price INT
)

CREATE TABLE Product (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(10)
)


Write a solution to report the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.

Return the resulting table in any order.


---
output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Extract and join product ID and product name from Sales table and Product table, use LEFT JOIN to get product name, select product_name, year and price fields.",
  "sql": "select Product.product_name, Sales.year, Sales.price from Sales left join Product on (Sales.product_id = Product.product_id);"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
