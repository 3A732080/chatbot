Example of the third  question
---

CREATE TABLE World (
    name VARCHAR(255),
    continent VARCHAR(255),
    area INT,
    population INT,
    gdp BIGINT
)


A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Use OR to join two conditions. One of the conditions is that the area is greater than or equal to three million square kilometers; the other condition is that the population is greater than or equal to 25 million. Next, in the SELECT clause, specify that the fields to be returned are the country's name, population, and area. Finally return to eligible countries",
  "sql": "select name,area, population from world where area >= 3000000 or population >= 25000000;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
