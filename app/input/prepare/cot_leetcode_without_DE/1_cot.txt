I hope you can assist me in solving some SQL issues. I will present you with examples to ponder, with each scenario involving a distinct database, and every problem being independent. Please consider the problems and databases outlined below, and describe your reasoning process for resolving them. Afterward, I will pose SQL questions, and I would like you to provide both the solutions and the rationale behind them.

Example of first question
---

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT,
    low_fats CHAR(1) CONSTRAINT CHK_Products_low_fats CHECK (low_fats IN ('Y', 'N')),
    recyclable CHAR(1) CONSTRAINT CHK_Products_recyclable CHECK (recyclable IN ('Y', 'N'))
)


Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Select product_id in the Products table, where low_fats is 'Y' and recyclable is also 'Y', and finally return these qualified product_ids.",
  "sql": "SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
