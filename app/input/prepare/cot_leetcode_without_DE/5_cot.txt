CREATE TABLE Tweets (
    tweet_id INT,
    content VARCHAR(50)
)


Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Return the result table in any order.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Use the WHERE clause to filter tweets whose content exceeds 15 characters, that is, len(content) > 15. Finally, select the tweet_id field in the SELECT clause to filter out the IDs of invalid tweets.",
  "sql": "select tweet_id from tweets where len(content)>15;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
