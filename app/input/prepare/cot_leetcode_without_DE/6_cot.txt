Example of the sixth question
---

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20)
)

CREATE TABLE EmployeeUNI (
    id INT,
    unique_id INT
)


Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "In order to display the unique ID of each user, if the user does not have a unique ID, null will be displayed, so use LEFT JOIN to join the Employees table and the EmployeeUNI table, and specify the join condition through E.id = EU.id to ensure that the The employee's ID corresponds to the unique ID. Finally, select unique_id from the EmployeeUNI table and name from the Employees table in the SELECT clause to display the unique ID and name of each consumer.",
  "sql": "select EU.unique_id , E.name from Employees E left join EmployeeUNI EU on E.id = EU.id;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
