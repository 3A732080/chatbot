CREATE TABLE Insurance (
    pid INT,
    tiv_2015 FLOAT,
    tiv_2016 FLOAT,
    lat FLOAT,
    lon FLOAT
)

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Calculate the sum of the investment values of all policyholders in 2016 (tiv_2016), provided that their tiv_2015 values are the same as other policyholders and their geographical location is unique. Calculate count based on tiv_2015 and (lat,lon) for each record using CTE or subquery. Use window function COUNT() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) to group and count tiv_2015 and (lat, lon). Filter out the records that meet the criteria, then calculate the sum of tiv_2016 and round off.",
  "sql": "SELECT ROUND(SUM([tiv_2016]),2) as [tiv_2016] FROM ( SELECT * ,COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY [LAT],[LON]) AS [ROW] ,COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY [tiv_2015]) as [TIV] FROM [INSURANCE] ) T1 WHERE 1=1 AND [ROW] = 1 AND [TIV] != 1;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
