The question asks for the customer name and the total quantity of items ordered for each customer who has placed at least one order.\n2. To get the customer names, we need to join the Customers and Orders tables using the cid column, which represents the customer's unique identifier.\n3. To calculate the total quantity of items ordered for each customer, we need to group the orders by customer (using the cid column) and sum the qty column (which represents the quantity of each item ordered) for each customer.\n4. To filter out customers who have not placed any orders, we need to use a subquery to ensure that the cid column in the Orders table has at least one matching row in the Customers table.\n5. Alternatively, we can use an aggregate function with a GROUP BY clause to summarize the data, and then join the result with the Customers table to obtain the customer names.\n\n**SQL Solution:**\n\n```sql\n-- Subquery approach\nSELECT c.customer, SUM(o.qty) AS total_qty\nFROM Customers c\nINNER JOIN Orders o ON c.cid = o.cid\nWHERE c.cid IN (SELECT cid FROM Orders)\nGROUP BY c.cid;\n\n-- Aggregate function approach\nSELECT c.customer, SUM(o.qty) AS total_qty\nFROM Customers c\nINNER JOIN Orders o ON c.cid = o.cid\nGROUP BY c.cid\nORDER BY c.customer;\n```"

The question asks for the employee's full name, department name, and salary for all employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, or who work in the Sales department and are managers.\n2. To get the employee's full name, we need to join the Employees and Salaries tables using the eid column, which represents the employee's unique identifier.\n3. To get the department name, we need to join the Employees table with the Departments table using the department column, which represents the department ID.\n4. To calculate the average salary in each department, we need to group the Salaries table by department (using the department column) and calculate the average of the salary column for each department.\n5. To filter out employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, we need to use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department and then compare the employee's salary to that average.\n6. To filter out employees who work in the Sales department and are managers, we can check the department column in the Employees table and the title column in the Job_History table.\n\n**SQL Solution:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, s.salary\nFROM Employees e\nINNER JOIN Salaries s ON e.eid = s.eid\nINNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department = d.did\nWHERE (s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Salaries WHERE department = e.department))\n  OR (e.department = 'Sales' AND e.eid IN (SELECT eid FROM Job_History WHERE title = 'Manager'));\n```"

The question asks for the employee's full name, department name, and salary for all employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, or who work in the Sales department and have a manager with a salary of more than $60,000 and have been with the company for more than 2 years.\n2. To get the employee's full name, we need to join the Employees and Salaries tables using the eid column, which represents the employee's unique identifier.\n3. To get the department name, we need to join the Employees table with the Departments table using the department column, which represents the department ID.\n4. To calculate the average salary in each department, we need to group the Salaries table by department (using the department column) and calculate the average of the salary column for each department.\n5. To filter out employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, we need to use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department and then compare the employee's salary to that average.\n6. To filter out employees who work in the Sales department and have a manager with a salary of more than $60,000 and have been with the company for more than 2 years, we need to join the Employees table with the Job_History table using the eid column, and then filter the results to only include employees who meet the specified criteria.\n\n**SQL Solution:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, s.salary\nFROM Employees e\nINNER JOIN Salaries s ON e.eid = s.eid\nINNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department = d.did\nWHERE (s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Salaries WHERE department = e.department))\n  OR (e.department = 'Sales' AND e.hire_date < DATE('now', '-2 years') AND e.eid IN (SELECT eid FROM Job_History WHERE salary > 60000));\n```"

The question asks for the employee's full name, department name, and salary for all employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, or who work in the Sales department and have been with the company for more than 6 years and have a manager with a salary of more than $60,000.\n2. To get the employee's full name, we need to join the Employees and Salaries tables using the eid column, which represents the employee's unique identifier.\n3. To get the department name, we need to join the Employees table with the Departments table using the department column, which represents the department ID.\n4. To calculate the average salary in each department, we need to group the Salaries table by department (using the department column) and calculate the average of the salary column for each department.\n5. To filter out employees who earn more than the average salary in their department, we need to use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each department and then compare the employee's salary to that average.\n6. To filter out employees who work in the Sales department and have been with the company for more than 6 years and have a manager with a salary of more than $60,000, we need to join the Employees table with the Job_History table using the eid column, and then filter the results to only include employees who meet the specified criteria.\n\n**SQL Solution:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, s.salary\nFROM Employees e\nINNER JOIN Salaries s ON e.eid = s.eid\nINNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department = d.did\nWHERE (s.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Salaries WHERE department = e.department))\n  OR (e.department = 'Sales' AND e.hire_date < DATE('now', '-6 years') AND e.eid IN (SELECT eid FROM Job_History WHERE salary > 60000));\n```"
