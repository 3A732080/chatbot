I hope you can assist me in solving some SQL issues. I will present you with examples to ponder, with each scenario involving a distinct database, and every problem being independent. Please consider the problems and databases outlined below, and describe your reasoning process for resolving them. Afterward, I will pose SQL questions, and I would like you to provide both the solutions and the rationale behind them.

Example of first question
---
Table: Products
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

{
  "reasoning_process" : "The product must be low fat (low_fats is "Y") and recyclable (recyclable is "Y"). This query will select Product_ids from the Products table that match these two criteria.",
  "sql": "SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
