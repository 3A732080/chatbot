The result table will contain two columns: transactions_count which is the number of transactions done in one visit. visits_count which is the corresponding number of users who did transactions_count in one visit to the bank. transactions_count should take all values from 0 to max(transactions_count) done by one or more users.

Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Count the number of transactions per visit. Count the number of visits for each different number of transactions. Includes access without any transactions. A record is generated for each possible number of transactions, even if some transaction numbers do not have a corresponding number of visits. Use CTE or subquery and max_trans to calculate the maximum number of transactions per visit, seq is used to generate a sequence from 0 to the maximum number of transactions, and trans_count is used to calculate the number of transactions per visit. This information is then combined to calculate the number of visits for each transaction number.",
  "sql": "WITH max_trans AS ( SELECT V.user_id, V.visit_date, COUNT(T.transaction_date) AS max_transactions_count FROM Visits V LEFT JOIN Transactions T ON V.user_id = T.user_id AND V.visit_date = T.transaction_date GROUP BY V.user_id, V.visit_date ), seq AS ( SELECT 0 AS transactions_count, MAX(max_transactions_count) AS max_transactions_count FROM max_trans UNION ALL SELECT transactions_count + 1, max_transactions_count FROM seq WHERE transactions_count < max_transactions_count ), trans_count AS ( SELECT V.user_id, V.visit_date, COUNT(T.transaction_date) AS transactions_count FROM Visits V LEFT JOIN Transactions T ON V.user_id = T.user_id AND V.visit_date = T.transaction_date GROUP BY V.user_id, V.visit_date ) SELECT seq.transactions_count, COALESCE(COUNT(trans_count.user_id), 0) AS visits_count FROM seq LEFT JOIN trans_count ON seq.transactions_count = trans_count.transactions_count GROUP BY seq.transactions_count ORDER BY seq.transactions_count;"

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
