Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Find prices for all products on 2019-08-16. Assume that all products have a price of 10 before any price changes. Identify the last price change for each product before 2019-08-16. For products that have a recorded price change after this date, treat their price as 10. Use UNION ALL to combine the results of two scenarios: one to find products with the last price change, and one with no price change records or all price changes recorded after this date.",
  "sql": "SELECT p.product_id, p.new_price AS price FROM Products p WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) AS last_change FROM Products WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16' GROUP BY product_id HAVING product_id = p.product_id AND MAX(change_date) = p.change_date ) UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT(p.product_id), 10 AS price FROM Products p WHERE product_id IN ( SELECT product_id FROM Products GROUP BY product_id HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16' );"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
