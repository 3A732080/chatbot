{
  "query": "Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who: have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique). Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.",
  "database_structure": {
    "Insurance": {
      "structure": [
        {"name": "pid", "DataType": "int"},
        {"name": "tiv_2015", "DataType": "float"},
        {"name": "tiv_2016", "DataType": "float"},

        {"name": "lon", "DataType": "float"}
      ],
      "PrimaryKey": "pid",
      "Explanation" : "pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. Each row of this table contains information about one policy where: pid is the policyholder's policy ID. tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016. lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL. lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.",
      "data": [
        {"pid": 1, "tiv_2015": 10, "tiv_2016": 5, "lat": 10, "lon": 10},

      ]
    }
  },
  "prompt_for_CoT": "Please explain the process from problem to generating SQL queries following the chain of thought method.",

    ],
    "rows": [
      {"tiv_2016": 45.00}
    ],
    "Explanation" : "The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria. The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique. The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too. So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45."
  }

Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Calculate the sum of the investment values of all policyholders in 2016 (tiv_2016), provided that their tiv_2015 values are the same as other policyholders and their geographical location is unique. Calculate count based on tiv_2015 and (lat,lon) for each record using CTE or subquery. Use window function COUNT() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) to group and count tiv_2015 and (lat, lon). Filter out the records that meet the criteria, then calculate the sum of tiv_2016 and round off.",
  "sql": "SELECT ROUND(SUM([tiv_2016]),2) as [tiv_2016] FROM ( SELECT * ,COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY [LAT],[LON]) AS [ROW] ,COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY [tiv_2015]) as [TIV] FROM [INSURANCE] ) T1 WHERE 1=1 AND [ROW] = 1 AND [TIV] != 1;"
}

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
