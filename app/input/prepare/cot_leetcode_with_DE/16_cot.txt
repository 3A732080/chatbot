Table: Triangle
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output:
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+

  "reasoning_process" : "Check whether the length of each set of line segments meets the conditions for forming a triangle: the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Use the CASE statement to make a judgment. If it matches, it will return 'Yes', if it doesn't match, it will return 'No'.",

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
