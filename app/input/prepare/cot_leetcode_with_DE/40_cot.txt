Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31. period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded.

Please reply in json format according to the above structure, without redundant output and escape characters, so that I can get the MS SQL syntax for testing:
example(No escape characters):

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Displays the status (success or failure) of tasks for each consecutive time period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. Tasks run each day either succeed or fail, and each task is independent of the previous task. By combining the Failed and Succeeded tables, create a merged table containing all task dates and their status. Use the ROW_NUMBER() function and the window function to assign a grouping mark grp to the task date in each state. Treat records with the same grp value as consecutive time periods, aggregate task dates based on this grouping tag, calculate the minimum and maximum dates for each group, and get the start and end dates of each time period. Sort the results by start date and return the required format.",
  "sql": "WITH combined AS ( SELECT fail_date AS task_date, 'failed' AS period_state FROM Failed WHERE fail_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' UNION ALL SELECT success_date AS task_date, 'succeeded' AS period_state FROM Succeeded WHERE success_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31' ), ranked AS ( SELECT task_date, period_state, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY task_date) - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY period_state ORDER BY task_date) AS grp FROM combined ) SELECT period_state, MIN(task_date) AS start_date, MAX(task_date) AS end_date FROM ranked GROUP BY period_state, grp ORDER BY start_date;"

Next I want to ask a question....
