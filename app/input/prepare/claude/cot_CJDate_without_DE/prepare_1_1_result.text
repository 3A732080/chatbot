Identify the required information:\n   - Color and city of parts\n   - Parts should not be located in Paris (non-Paris parts)\n   - Parts should have a weight greater than 10 pounds\n\n2. Analyze the database schema:\n   - The `Parts` table contains part information, including the `color`, `city`, and `weight` columns\n\n3. Filter the results:\n   - Add a condition in the WHERE clause to exclude parts located in Paris (`city <> 'Paris'`)\n   - Add another condition to include only parts with a weight greater than 10 pounds (`weight > 10.0`)\n\n4. Select the required columns:\n   - Select the `color` column from the `Parts` table\n   - Select the `city` column from the `Parts` table\n\nThe SQL query for the seventh question would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT color, city\nFROM Parts\nWHERE city <> 'Paris' AND weight > 10.0;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `color` and `city` columns from the `Parts` table. The conditions in the WHERE clause ensure that the parts are not located in Paris (`city <> 'Paris'`) and have a weight greater than 10 pounds (`weight > 10.0`).\n\nThe reasoning behind this solution is as follows:\n- We need to find the color and city of parts that are not located in Paris and have a weight greater than 10 pounds.\n- The `Parts` table contains the necessary information, including the `color`, `city`, and `weight` columns.\n- The condition `city <> 'Paris'` excludes parts located in Paris, ensuring we only consider non-Paris parts.\n- The condition `weight > 10.0` includes only parts with a weight greater than 10 pounds.\n- By selecting the `color` and `city` columns from the `Parts` table and applying these conditions, we get the desired result.\n\nPlease provide the next sample question, and I'll be glad to assist you further."

Let me describe the reasoning process and provide the SQL solution.\n\nReasoning Process for the Fourteenth Question:\n\n1. Identify the required information:\n   - Supplier numbers (sno) and status for suppliers in Paris\n   - Results should be in descending order of status\n\n2. Analyze the database schema:\n   - The `Suppliers` table contains supplier information, including the `sno` (supplier number), `status`, and `city` columns\n\n3. Filter the results:\n   - Add a condition in the WHERE clause to select suppliers located in Paris (`city = 'Paris'`)\n\n4. Order the results:\n   - Use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results based on the `status` column\n   - Specify the `DESC` keyword to sort in descending order\n\n5. Select the required columns:\n   - Select the `sno` and `status` columns from the `Suppliers` table\n\nThe SQL query for the fourteenth question would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT sno, status\nFROM Suppliers\nWHERE city = 'Paris'\nORDER BY status DESC;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `sno` and `status` columns from the `Suppliers` table. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only suppliers located in Paris (`city = 'Paris'`).

Select the required column:\n   - Select the result of the `SUM(qty)` function\n\nThe SQL query for the twenty-first question would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(qty)\nFROM Shipments\nWHERE pno = 'P2';\n```\n\nThis query selects the sum of the `qty` column from the `Shipments` table where the `pno` column is 'P2'. The `SUM(qty)` function is used to calculate the total quantity of part P2 supplied.\n\nThe reasoning behind this solution is as follows:\n- We need to find the total quantity of part P2 supplied.\n- The `Shipments` table contains the necessary information, including the `pno` and `qty` columns.\n- The WHERE clause with the condition `pno = 'P2'` filters the records to include only those related to part P2.\n- The `SUM(qty)` function is used to calculate the sum of the `qty` column for the filtered records, which gives us the total quantity of part P2 supplied.\n- By selecting the result of `SUM(qty)`, we retrieve the desired total quantity of part P2 supplied.\n\nPlease go ahead and ask your question. I'll be happy to assist you further."
