To avoid duplicate pairs and ensure that each pair of suppliers is listed only once, we add an additional condition in the WHERE clause: a.sno < b.sno. This condition ensures that the supplier number in the first column (a.sno) is smaller than the supplier number in the second column (b.sno).\n6. The SQL query selects the supplier numbers from both aliases (a.sno and b.sno) and renames them as \"sa\" and \"sb\" respectively in the SELECT statement.\n\nThe reasoning process involves understanding the given table, identifying the required columns, performing a self-join on the Suppliers table, filtering the results based on the condition that the suppliers are located in the same city, and adding an additional condition to avoid duplicate pairs and ensure a specific order of supplier numbers in each pair.\n\nPlease provide the next sample question whenever you're ready, and I'll do my best to provide a solution and explain the rationale behind it."

The EXISTS condition in the inner subquery ensures that there is at least one part supplied by the current supplier (SX.sno) that is also supplied by supplier S2.\n7. The EXISTS condition in the outer subquery ensures that the current supplier (SX.sno) supplies at least one part that is also supplied by supplier S2.\n8. Finally, the outer query returns the names of the suppliers (SX.sname) who satisfy the condition of supplying at least one part that is also supplied by supplier S2.\n\nThe reasoning process involves understanding the given tables, identifying the relationship between suppliers and parts in the Shipments table, and using nested subqueries with the EXISTS condition to check if a supplier supplies at least one part that is also supplied by supplier S2.\n\nPlease provide the next sample question whenever you're ready, and I'll do my best to provide a solution and explain the rationale behind it."

The question asks for the supplier numbers (sno) and status for suppliers located in Paris with a status greater than 20.\n2. To get the required information, we need to query the Suppliers table and apply two conditions in the WHERE clause.\n3. We start by selecting the supplier number (sno) and status from the Suppliers table (aliased as s).\n4. In the WHERE clause, we combine two conditions using the AND operator:\n   - The first condition specifies that the supplier must be located in Paris (s.CITY = 'Paris'). This ensures that we only consider suppliers from Paris.\n   - The second condition specifies that the supplier's status must be greater than 20 (s.STATUS > 20). This filters out suppliers with a status less than or equal to 20.\n5. The query will return the supplier numbers (sno) and status for suppliers who satisfy both conditions, i.e., located in Paris and having a status greater than 20.\n\nThe reasoning process involves understanding the given table, identifying the required columns (sno and status), and applying the necessary conditions in the WHERE clause to filter the results based on the supplier's city (Paris) and status (greater than 20).\n\nPlease provide the next sample question whenever you're ready, and I'll do my best to provide a solution and explain the rationale behind it."

The question asks for the total number of suppliers.\n2. To get the required information, we need to query the Suppliers table and count the number of records.\n3. We start by using the COUNT(*) function in the SELECT clause to count all the records in the Suppliers table.\n4. Since we want to count all the suppliers, there is no need for any additional conditions or filtering.\n5. The query will return the total count of records in the Suppliers table, which represents the total number of suppliers.\n\nThe reasoning process involves understanding the given tables, identifying the Suppliers table as the relevant table for counting suppliers, and using the COUNT(*) function to count all the records in the table without any additional conditions.\n\nPlease provide the next sample question whenever you're ready, and I'll do my best to provide a solution and explain the rationale behind it."

The question asks for the total number of suppliers currently supplying parts.\n2. To get the required information, we need to query the Shipments table and count the number of distinct suppliers.\n3. We start by using the COUNT() function in the SELECT clause to count the distinct values of the supplier number (sno) column from the Shipments table.\n4. The DISTINCT keyword is used within the COUNT() function to ensure that we only count unique supplier numbers, avoiding duplicates.\n5. By counting the distinct supplier numbers from the Shipments table, we obtain the number of different suppliers currently supplying parts.\n\nThe reasoning process involves understanding the given tables, identifying the Shipments table as the relevant table for determining the suppliers currently supplying parts, and using the COUNT(DISTINCT sno) function to count the unique supplier numbers from the Shipments table.\n\nPlease provide the next sample question whenever you're ready, and I'll do my best to provide a solution and explain the rationale behind it."
