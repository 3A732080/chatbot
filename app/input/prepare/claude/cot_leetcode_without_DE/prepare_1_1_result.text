The problem requires determining whether each set of three line segments (x, y, z) in the Triangle table can form a triangle.\n2. To form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. This condition needs to be checked for all three combinations of the sides.\n3. You use the `CASE WHEN` conditional expression to determine if each set of line segments can form a triangle.\n4. Inside the `CASE` expression, you check the three conditions required for a triangle to be formed:\n   - `x + y > z`: The sum of sides x and y is greater than side z.\n   - `x + z > y`: The sum of sides x and z is greater than side y.\n   - `y + z > x`: The sum of sides y and z is greater than side x.\n5. If all three conditions are satisfied simultaneously (`AND` operator), it means that the line segments can form a triangle. In this case, the `CASE` expression returns 'Yes'.\n6. If any of the conditions are not met, it means that the line segments cannot form a triangle, and the `CASE` expression returns 'No'.\n7.

The problem requires finding the person_name of the last person who can board the bus without exceeding the weight limit of 1000 kilograms.\n2. To determine the last person who can fit on the bus, you need to calculate the running total of weights for each person in the queue, based on their turn.\n3. You use a subquery to calculate the running total of weights. Inside the subquery, you select the necessary columns (person_id, person_name, weight, turn) from the Queue table.\n4. To calculate the running total, you use the `SUM` function with the `OVER` clause. The `SUM(weight)` expression calculates the cumulative sum of weights for each person.\n5. The `OVER` clause specifies the window frame for the running total calculation.

The `ROUND` function is used to round the average amount to two decimal places.\n6.

The problem requires finding all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in the Logs table.\n2. You start by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to create a temporary table that contains the current number (`num`), the previous number (`PrevNum`), and the next number (`NextNum`) for each row.\n3. Inside the CTE, you use the `LEAD` and `LAG` functions to get the next and previous numbers, respectively. The `LEAD` function retrieves the value from the next row, while the `LAG` function retrieves the value from the previous row, based on the specified ordering (`order by id`).\n4. By using `LEAD` and `LAG`, you can compare each number with its previous and next numbers to determine if they are consecutive.\n5. In the main query, you select from the CTE the numbers that appear three consecutive times. The condition `num = NextNum and NextNum = PrevNum` checks if the current number is equal to both the next number and the previous number, indicating that they are consecutive.\n6. Finally, you use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that only unique consecutive numbers are returned, eliminating any duplicates.\n\nYour SQL query correctly finds all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in the Logs table. It uses a CTE to retrieve the previous and next numbers for each row, and then selects the numbers where the current number is equal to both the previous and next numbers. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique consecutive numbers are returned.\n\nI'll keep this reasoning process in mind and await your next sample question."

The problem requires finding the median of all the numbers in the database after decompressing the Numbers table. The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.\n2. You start by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `CTE_Numbers` to create a temporary table that contains the `Number`, `Frequency`, `CumulativeSum`, and `TotalFrequency` for each row.\n3. Inside the CTE, you use the `SUM` function with the `OVER` clause to calculate the cumulative frequency (`CumulativeSum`) for each number. The `ORDER BY Number` ensures that the cumulative sum is calculated in ascending order of the numbers.\n4. You also calculate the total frequency (`TotalFrequency`) of all numbers using `SUM(Frequency) OVER ()`. This gives you the total count of all numbers in the decompressed table.\n5. To find the median, you use two subqueries within the main query.\n6. The first subquery finds the first number that is greater than or equal to half the total frequency. It uses `SELECT TOP 1` to retrieve the number from `CTE_Numbers` where the `CumulativeSum` is greater than or equal to `TotalFrequency / 2.0`, ordered by `Number` in ascending order.\n7. The second subquery finds the last number that is less than or equal to half the total frequency. It uses `SELECT TOP 1` to retrieve the number from `CTE_Numbers` where `CumulativeSum - Frequency` is less than `TotalFrequency / 2.0`, ordered by `Number` in descending order.\n8. The main query selects the average of the two numbers obtained from the subqueries using the `AVG` function. It uses `CAST(Number AS FLOAT)` to convert the numbers to floating-point values for accurate calculation.\n9. Finally, the `ROUND` function is used to round the calculated median to one decimal point.\n\nYour SQL query correctly finds the median of all the numbers in the database after decompressing the Numbers table. It uses a CTE to calculate the cumulative frequency and total frequency, and then uses two subqueries to find the numbers that are closest to half the total frequency.
