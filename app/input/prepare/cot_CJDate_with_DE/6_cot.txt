{
  "reasoning_process" : "Perform a self-join on the Suppliers table, create two aliases a and b to represent different supplier entities, and filter out the cases where the cities are the same (a.city = b.city) but the supplier numbers are different and a.sno ​​is smaller than b.sno , to ensure that each pair of suppliers is listed only once and is located in the same city",
  "sql": "select a.sno as sa, b.sno as sb from Suppliers as a, Suppliers as b where a.city = b.city and a.sno < b.sno ;"
}
