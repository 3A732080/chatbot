{
  "reasoning_process" : "Connect the three tables Suppliers, Shipments and Parts through the JOIN operation, match them based on the supplier number (sno) and part number (pno), and then filter out the situation where the suppliers and parts are located in different cities.",
  "sql": "SELECT DISTINCT S.city AS scity, P.city AS pcity FROM Suppliers S JOIN Shipments SH ON S.sno = SH.sno JOIN Parts P ON SH.pno = P.pno WHERE S.city <> P.city;"
}
