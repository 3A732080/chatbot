{
  "reasoning_process" : "The WHERE clause combines two conditions to achieve the number and status of all suppliers located in Paris and with a status greater than 20: first, it specifies that the supplier must be located in Paris; second, the supplier's status must be greater than 20.",
  "sql": "select s.sno, s.status from suppliers s WHERE s.CITY = 'Paris' AND s.STATUS > 20"
}
