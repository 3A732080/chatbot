CREATE TABLE Suppliers (

    sname VARCHAR(255),
    status INT,
    city VARCHAR(255)
)

CREATE TABLE Parts (

)

output

{
  "reasoning_process" : "Select the part number (pno) from the Shipments table and group the part numbers (GROUP BY Shipments.pno) to calculate the number of suppliers corresponding to each part number (COUNT(Shipments.sno)). Use the HAVING condition to filter out part numbers that have more than one supplier.",
  "sql": "select Shipments.pno from Shipments group by Shipments.pno having count ( Shipments.sno ) > 1 ;"
}
