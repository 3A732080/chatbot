{
  "reasoning_process" : "Use the WHERE clause to filter out suppliers whose city field is Paris, ensuring that only suppliers located in Paris are selected. Next, use the ORDER BY clause to sort by the status column in descending order.",
  "sql": "select sno, status from Suppliers where city = 'Paris' order by status desc"
}
