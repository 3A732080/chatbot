CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
    sno VARCHAR(255),
    sname VARCHAR(255),
    status INT,
    city VARCHAR(255)
)

CREATE TABLE Parts (

    qty INT
)


Question : Get the maximum and minimum quantity for part P2.

output
---
{
  "reasoning_process" : "Find all delivery records related to part P2 from the Shipments table, that is, pno = 'P2', and then use the max() and min() aggregate functions on qty respectively to calculate the maximum and minimum quantities of these delivery records, and finally use The SELECT clause returns these two results as maxq and minq.",
  "sql": "select max ( Shipments.qty ) as maxq, min ( Shipments.qty ) as minq from Shipments where Shipments.pno = 'P2' ;"
}
