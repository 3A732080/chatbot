Table: MyNumbers
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
Example 2:

Input:
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output:
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

  "reasoning_process" : "Find the largest number that appears only once in the MyNumbers table. If there is no matching number, null is returned. First filter out numbers that only appear once through GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(num) = 1, and then use the MAX(num) function to find the maximum value from these numbers.",

Please keep in mind the reasoning process for solving the problem, I will provide the next sample question later...
