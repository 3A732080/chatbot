{
  "reasoning_process" : "Obtain all possible combinations of suppliers and parts by performing Cartesian product from the Suppliers table and the Parts table, and filter the combinations that are located in the same city and whose supplier status is not 20",
  "sql": "SELECT S.*, P.pno, P.pname, P.city FROM Suppliers S, Parts P WHERE S.City = P.City AND S.Status <> 20"
}
