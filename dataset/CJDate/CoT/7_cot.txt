{
  "reasoning_process" : "Parts must be located in a non-Paris city (city is not equal to 'Paris') and weigh more than 10 pounds (weight is greater than 10.0). This query will select the color and city that match these two conditions from the Parts table.",
  "sql": "select px.color, px.city from Parts as px where px.city <> 'Paris' and px.weight > 10.0 ;"
}
